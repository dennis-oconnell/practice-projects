## Project Reflection

- Date: 01/24/24
- This practice project is complete! Yay!
- This was a useful project for me to practice methods and interfaces and see how they can work together.
- I feel that I better understand why pointer receivers are valuable and sometimes necessary in Go
- Pointers used to scare the crap out of me, and now I feel that I understand them better and can appreciate them
- I also learned how to initialize an interface
- In the method for TaskManager that marks a task as complete, I probably could have and should have used error handling
- Though I do check for an index out of bounds, I only print out that the index was invalid.
- This program could be improved by returning an error when the index is out of bounds, but I have yet to get to the error section of the Go Tour and I will wait until I get there to start working with them.
