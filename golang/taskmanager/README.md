# Go Task Manager Small Project

This is a small project meant to solidify what I am currently learning about methods in go.

### Task 1: Define a 'Task' struct with fields for title, description, and status

### Task 2: Create a method to initialize a new task

### Task 3: Implement a method to mark a task as completed

### Task 4: Add a method to display task details

### Task 5: Create a simple task manager that holds a list of tasks.

### Task 6: Add methods to the task manager to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and display all tasks.
