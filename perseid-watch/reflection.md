1. **Achievement of Goals (Did you accomplish the initial goals and objectives you set for the project?)**

   - I accomplished my goal of creating a basic countdown timer website with a clean background that is fully sized to the size of the window.

2. **Learning and Technical Skills (What new technologies or skills did you learn and apply during the project?)**

   - I used vanilla JS, html, and css. I learned about javascript dates and how time is handled.

3. **Challenges and Problem Solving(What were the main challenges you faced, and how did you overcome them?)**

   - I struggled a bit with calculating the time left because when I subtracted two dates the answer was in miliseconds. I had to convert that length of time into remaining months, days, hours, and seconds.

4. **Feedback and Improvement (Did you receive feedback, and how did you incorporate it? What improvements would you make?)**

   - My website does not currently scale down to mobile. This project could be improved by making it more mobile friendly and responsive.

5. **Personal Growth and Enjoyment(In what ways did you grow as a developer, and what aspects of the project did you enjoy the most?)**
   - I feel more comfortable working with dates in javascript. I also feel like I have a better understanding of why certain fonts are used in the layout of the page. I learned why the model I used utilized different fonts for different sections of the page.
